A web-based explicit control evaluator for C

The C-interpreter project applies the notion of an explicit-control evaluator (Module 3) to the language C. Baseline expectations:

    Web-based implementation based on Source Academy frontend and js-slang (see GitHub 

Links to an external site.)
Implementation of a sublanguage of C, consistent with a recent language specification
Language constructs: variable and function declarations, blocks, conditionals statements and expressions, while loops
Implementation should use an explicit-control evaluator, using a suitable abstraction for C's runtime stack.
Memory management: the language needs to include heap allocation (malloc) and support pointer arithmetic and * and &.
Optional components:

    visualization of heap and runtime stack
    type checking
    function pointers
