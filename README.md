# CS4215-project

A web-based explicit control evaluator for C

### Overview

The C-interpreter project applies the notion of an [explicit-control evaluator](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/sicpjs/5.4) to the language C. Baseline expectations:

- Web-based implementation based on Source Academy frontend and [js-slang](https://github.com/source-academy)

- Implementation of a sublanguage of C, consistent with a recent language specification

- Language constructs: variable and function declarations, blocks, conditionals statements and expressions, while loops

- Implementation should use an explicit-control evaluator, using a suitable abstraction for C's runtime stack.

- Memory management: the language needs to include heap allocation (malloc) and support pointer arithmetic and * and &.

Optional components:

- Visualization of heap and runtime stack

- Type checking

- Function pointers
